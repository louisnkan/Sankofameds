            <h3>From the Founder</h3>
            <p>Growing up in Nigeria, I witnessed the disconnect between traditional healing practices passed down through generations and the formal healthcare system. My grandmother treated ailments with herbs whose names I couldn't even spell, yet doctors dismissed them as "unscientific folklore."</p>
            <p>This platform was born from a simple question: What if we could validate ancestral wisdom with modern research? Africa's biodiversity holds pharmaceutical potential worth billions, yet our own communities lack access to reliable information about plants growing in their backyards.</p>
            <p>SankofaMeds is my contribution to preserving this knowledge before it disappears with the elders who hold it. Every citation, every safety warning, every local name documented here is a step toward reclaiming our medical heritage while building trust through transparency and science.</p>
            <p>This is not just a database—it's a movement to make African traditional medicine accessible, credible, and profitable for the communities that stewarded this knowledge for millennia.</p>
